# Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python

## Step 1: 
- Choose data structure for recipes
    I chose dictionaries as my data structure for each recipe. I chose dictionaries because they have keys that can store different values in itself. I needed to save a recipe name, cook time, and ingredients list inside each key, the recipe.
## Step 2: 
- Create first recipe with recipe name, cooking time, and ingredients
## Step 3: 
- Create all_recipes outer structure and add all recipes to it
## Step 4: 
- Create four additional recipes with the same attributes
## Step 5: 
- Print all_recipes inside IPython shell
## Step 6: 
- Complete reflection questions for exercise 1.2 in the learning journal and screenshot each step and add folder of screenshots
