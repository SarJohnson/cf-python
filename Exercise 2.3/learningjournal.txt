Exercise 2.3 Django Models
Reflection Questions

1.	Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are.
    Django models are a key component of the Django web framework, providing a layer for interacting with databases. 
    They define the structure of a database table, allowing developers to create, read, update, and delete records. 
    Models in Django are created as Python classes, with each class representing a table in the database. 
    The benefits of Django models include code reusability. 
    Additionally, Django models facilitate the use of the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) approach, making it easier to work with databases using Python objects.

2.	In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. 
    You can take an example project to explain your answer.
    Writing test cases from the beginning of a project is crucial because it helps catch issues early in the development cycle, reducing the likelihood of bugs persisting. 
    For example, in an e-commerce website project, early test cases forfeatures like product search and checkout processes ensure that critical functionalities work as intended from the start. 
    This proactive testing approach saves time and resources by preventing defects, ensuring code stability, and facilitating smoother project progression.
