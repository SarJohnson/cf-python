Exercise 2.4 Django MVT Revisited
Reflection Questions

1.	In your own words, explain Django static files and how Django handles them.
    Django static files are the assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and images that are used to style and enhance the functionality of a web application. 
    These files are separate from dynamic content and remain constant across requests. Django handles static files by using the "django.contrib.staticfiles" app.
    During development, the "django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder" automatically looks for static files in each app's "static" directory. 
    In production, the collected static files can be served by a web server.

2.	Look up the following two Django packages on Django’s official documentation and/or other trusted sources. Write a brief description of each.
    Package	        Description
    ListView        CBV that is used to display a list of objects. It renders a template with the list of objects and provides pagination support for large datasets.
    DetailView      CBV that is designed to display the details of a single object. It retrieves an object based on a specified URL parameter and renders a template with information about that particular object.

3.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 2! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? 
    What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? 
    I am happy with my progress in this course so far. I am particularly proud of understanding many of Django's capabilities such as models and views. 
    However, I do think I need to continue to practice with Django models, views, and templates to fully feel comfortable with everything.
